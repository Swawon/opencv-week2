# OpenCV Week 2 – Motion Detection & Camera Integrity

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook code implementations for:
- Streaming RTSP feeds with OpenCV
- Real-time motion detection using frame differencing and background subtraction
- Camera integrity checks (covered, blurred, or laser-affected detection)
- Displaying visual warnings on frames in real-time

## ⚙️ Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure the following are installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless jupyter numpy
```
##  ⚙️Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swawon/opencv-week2.git
